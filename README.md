# Cryptocurrency Price Checker for Amazon Alexa
This is a simple lambda function that uses an external API to get the current price of cryptocurrencies on [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/). The function is used with Amazon Alexa and can be paired with an Alexa skill.

## Goal
My goal with this project was to create a simple and easy to use reference for the cryptocurrency market with Amazon's Alexa SDK. 

## Released on Amazon Skills Store
I was able to accomplish my initial goal and have the application respond to user input.
Towards the end of January 2018, I released the application on the Amazon Skills Store and have received great reviews so far.

Here is the link to the application on Amazon's store: [Cryptocurrency Prices](https://www.amazon.com/Ryan-Ward-Tech-Cryptocurrency-Prices/dp/B07984JLFT/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1519843148&sr=1-1&keywords=cryptocurrency+prices)

## Examples
**User Input:** "Alexa, ask coin check for the current price of Bitcoin." <br />
**Alexa Response:** "Okay, the current price of Bitcoin is $11,500 USD."

**User Input:** "Alexa, ask coin check for the top coins." <br />
**Alexa Response:** "Okay, the top five cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin." 

## Future Plans
In the future, I hope to support different world currencies such as the Canadian dollar, the Euro, etc. Additionally in the future I plan on supporting more information about the cryptocurrencies such as 24h price change, etc.
